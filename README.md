# Customer_Behavior_Analysis-
Data analytics project showcasing Customer Behavior analysis using Python , SQL , Power BI .
This project is all about making sense of customer habits.
I worked through the data to find out who the best customers are,
what they like to buy, and when they are most active. The goal was to create a clear, 
easy-to-read report that helps a company focus its efforts on the right people at the right time.
